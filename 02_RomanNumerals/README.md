# 02 - Roman Numerals
* **Date**: 11th July 2012
* **Setter**: Lee-Jon Ball & Joe James
* **Difficulty**: Easy

## Introduction
After the first Ed presented Lee-Jon with an alternative to FizzBuzz. Firstly the divisors were the harder 3 and 7, and instead of saying the number (when not Fizz or Buzz or FizzBuzz) you have to say that number in roman numerals

So instead of saying 1, 2, Fizz, 4, 5, Fizz, Buzz... you would say "i, i i, Fizz, i v, v, Fizz, Buzz.... and so on. A solution to the first 100 was provided in the [FizzBuzz writeup](http://github.com/Alliants/codekata/01_FizzBuzz/solution.md)

## Ruby Challenge
Add the correct method to the FizzBuzz program so it outputs the results shown in the previous writeup.

Link to program [fizzroman.rb](http://github.com/Alliants/codekata/02_RomanNumerals/fizzroman.rb)

## Solution
To be provided by Tuesday 10th July 2012.
