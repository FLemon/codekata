## Instructions

Make sure you have git set-up correctly

    git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
    git config --global user.email "youremail@server.com"

Clone the repository and create a branch to work with. Use the branching structure

    git clone
    git checkout -b "initials_testnumber_nameofbranch"

e.g.

    git checkout -b "ljb_001_if_else_solution"

Go into the folder of the test you want to do. In that folder create a folder with your git username. For example:

    mkdir lee-jon
    mkdir hatchws

Keep all files in that folder. Issue a pull request back to the repository once you're done.

Happy hacking!
